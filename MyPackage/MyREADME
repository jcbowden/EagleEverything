30/04/15  the eigen calculation in emma.REMLE is a bottlenck.  I have been experimenting with different ways of calculating this
          in R.  

          I have tried eigen vs svd.  svd is faster but not for eigen, symmetric=TRUE which is what I have. 

          I have been talking to Josh about slotting in different BLAST and LaPACK libraries. 

          I have tried nvblas which is a gpu'ized BLAST library. Josh provided the following code in his email dated 29/04/15

# NVBlas requirements:
# create an interactive session with all cores and GPUs:
salloc  --nodes=1 --tasks-per-node=1 --cpus-per-task=16 --mem=128000 --time=4:00:00 --gres=gpu:3 srun --pty /bin/bash

# set up modules:
module load intel-mkl cuda/6.5.14  R/3.1.3

# set up mkl and nvblas environment:
export NVBLAS_CONFIG_FILE=/apps/cuda/6.0/cuda/nvblas.conf
export OMP_NUM_THREADS=16

# The following will start R:
LD_PRELOAD=/cm/shared/apps/cuda65/toolkit/6.5.14/lib64/libnvblas.so R


      Also Trying rcppMagma package by Josh for fast GPU calculation
       ------------------------------------------------------------

     module load magma/1.6.1  R/3.1.1
     export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/apps/magma/1.6.1/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
     R
     library(rcppMagma)




        Also trying PLASMA and HiPLARb 
        -------------------------------  
        
module load plasma/2.7.1
module load intel-mkl  R/3.1.3

    Had problems. Not easy to install since it requires the location of lapack, 
    plasma, magma, cuda, and atlas(?) libraries.  Have requested help from hpchelp@csiro.au (30/04/15)
